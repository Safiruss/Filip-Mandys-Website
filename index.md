## Short Biography
I am currently working as a *Senior Researcher* at the [Research Institute for Labour and Social Affairs](https://www.rilsa.cz/en/){:.heading.flip-title} (RILSA). My current research focuses on energy economics, labour economics, and macroeconomic analysis of the Czech labour market, in cooperation with the Czech [Ministry of Labour](https://www.mpsv.cz/web/en){:.heading.flip-title}. Previously, I have worked as a *Research Consultant* in the [Research and Market Analysis](https://www.eif.org/news_centre/research/index.htm){:.heading.flip-title} (RMA) division of the [European Investment Fund](https://www.eif.org/){:.heading.flip-title} (EIF) in Luxembourg. My research at EIF focused on the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), particularly the private equity, venture capital, and business angel investors, green finance, ESG aspects, and the impact of the current geopolitical and energy crisis.

I hold a PhD in Economics from the [University of Surrey](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/school-economics){:.heading.flip-title} and my thesis focused on the demand and pricing aspects of clean and conventional automobiles in the United Kingdom. I received my MSc in International Economics, Finance, and Development, and BSc in Economics and Finance from the University of Surrey.
